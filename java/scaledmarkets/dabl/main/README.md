## Compiler Top Level Structure

The <code>scaledmarkets.dabl.parser.Parser</code> class parses input and builds an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The language grammar and the AST structure are
both defined in the DABL language grammar spec,
[`dabl.sablecc`](https://github.com/Scaled-Markets/dabl/blob/master/dabl.sablecc).
The <code>scaledmarkets.dabl.parser.Parser</code> class is
generated by the [SableCC parser generator](http://www.sablecc.org/),
based on the `dabl.sablecc` grammar.

The `LanguageAnalyzer` extends a base class that builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST),
as defined by the `dabl.sablecc` file. This AST construction constitutes the
Parse phase.

## Key Dynamic Structures

The compiler's dynamic structure is completely encapsulated in the
[`CompilerState`](CompilerState.java) object.
The argument-less `process()` method creates a `CompilerState` instance and provides
it when constructing a `LanguageAnalyzer`.

The dynamic structures are shown in the following Figure. The `CompilerState`
object is returned by the compiler.

## Language Analyzer

The [LanguageAnalyzer](LanguageAnalyzer.java) class performs the Analysis processing phase
(see https://github.com/Scaled-Markets/dabl/tree/master/langref#processing-phases).

The Analysis phase walks the tree in a depth-first manner, visiting each `Node`,
calling the `in`*Node-Type*(`Node`) method on entry to each Node, and the
`out`*Node-Type*(`Node`) method on exit from the `Node`. The `LanguageAnalyzer`
class provides these methods, as overrides of `in`*Node-Type*(`Node`) and
`out`*Node-Type*(`Node`) methods from the base class. These methods
perform actions such as name resolution and evaluate some static
expressions. The outcome of the Analysis phase
is a hashtable of `Annotations`, indexed by `Node`: thus, Analysis effectively annotates
the AST, since for any `Node`, one can look up its `Annotation` (if any).

The Analysis phase also produces a symbol table tree, with one table corresponding
to each nested scope within the source input.

The Language Analyzer annotates the AST, as shown in the figure.

Symbols are organized into symbol tables, as depicted in the figure.

## Compiler Output

The compiler returns a [`CompilerState`](CompilerState.java) object. In the
`CompilerState`, the `globalScope` variable references the root level
[`NameScope`](NameScope.java) object.
A `NameScope` references a [`SymbolTable`](SymbolTable.java) consisting of
[`SymbolEntries`](SymbolEntry.java).
`SymbolEntries` that are [`NameScopeEntries`](NameScopeEntry.java) own their
own `NameScopes`,
which in turn reference their own `SymbolTables`, creating a hierarchy
of `NameScopes`.

The `CompilerState` also references an abstract syntax tree (AST),
whose structure is defined by the Abstract Syntax Tree section of the
[dabl.sablecc](https://github.com/Scaled-Markets/dabl/blob/master/dabl.sablecc)
file,
and which can be accessed via the methods in the generated `scaledmarkets.dabl.node` package.
The AST node Java classes are generated by the build process; their Javadocs
can be found in package `scaledmarkets.dabl.node` of the
[generated javadocs](https://scaledmarkets.github.io/dabl/).

The linkage between the AST and the `NameScope` hierarchy is as follows:
`SymbolEntries` that are [`DeclaredEntries`](DeclaredEntry.java)
provide a `getDefiningNode()` method, which provides a reference to
the AST `Node` that declares the symbol that the `SymbolEntry` defines.
