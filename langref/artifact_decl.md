# Artifact Declaration
An artifact declaration defines a versioned artifact that is produced by the DABL
file. An artifact declaration can specify compatibility with versions of other
artifacts, and can assert which versions it has actually been tested with.
Such assertions are not verified: they are design-time assertions. However, a
tool could attempt to verify the assertions.
