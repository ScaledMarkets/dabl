# Task Declaration

## Purpose

A task declaration is a named process to be performed when specified conditions
are met. The process is performed in complete isolation from other processes
that are defined in the DABL file, and no environment inheritance exists from
the DABL environment or from one task to another. A typical implementation of
a task is a Linux container.

The conditions that trigger execution are specified by the taskâ€™s when clause.
If there is no when clause, then the following when clause is assumed:
```
when inputs are newer than outputs
```
## Syntax

A task declaration has the following syntax:

  [`public`] `task` *name* [ [when_clause](when_clause.md) ]
  	[ [input_set...](input_set.md) ] [ [output_set...](output_set.md) ]
  	[ [procedural_stmts](procedural_stmt.md)...]

If the input_set or output_set defines a name for the inputs or outputs,
respectively, the name is scoped to the enclosing task.

## Example

```
task compileit
    when inputs A newer than outputs
    inputs A $thisdir/**.java from "my_repo" in my_git, XYZ
    outputs ./**.class, ./**.txt
    bash "
        javac $thisdir/*.java
        "
```

In this example,

* A task named "compileit" is defined.
* An input set called "A" is defined.
* Another input set called "XYZ" is defined.
* An output set (with no name) is defined.
* The task will be invoked whenever at least one file of input set A has a more recent
timestamp than all of the files that are specified by the output set.
* When the task is invoked, the bash command will be performed, after the value
of $thisdir has been substituted. ($thisdir evaluates to the directory in which
the DABL script exists.)
