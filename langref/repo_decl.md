# Repo Declaration

## Purpose

A repo declaration identifies an external repository, and gives it a name that
can be referenced within the DABL file. The repo declaration specifies how to
connect to the repo, including specifying credentials. Normally, credentials
would be specified using environment variables, so that they are not hard-coded
into the file.
