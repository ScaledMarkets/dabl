# DABL Language Reference

The elements of a DABL file are as follows:

* [Namespace Declaration](namespace_decl.md)
* Import Declarations
* Typographic Declarations
* Artifact Declarations
* Repo Declarations
* File Declarations
* Function Declarations
* Task Declarations
* Shell Declarations

The ordering of these things is immaterial. However, there can be only one namespace declaration.
